#Project Design
A broad outline of the theoretical workflow is summarised below:
.1.Data Exploration & Cleaning
○ Explore the data
○ Clean the raw input datasets (missing values, features to keep or drop, revisions of data formats)
○ Create a function with the pre-processing steps

2.Data Visualisation 
○Visualise the data
○Identify correlations between features or other data-specific patterns

3.Feature Engineering
○Make informed decisions about features to drop/keep with a PCA implementation

4.Model Selection
○ Experiment with different algorithms in Step 1 (unsupervised learning, e.g. K- Means Clustering)
○Experiment with different algorithms in Step 2 (supervised learning, e.g. DecisionTreeRegressor)
○Select the best-suited algorithms for the problem

5.Model Training & Tuning
○Train the model defined previously
○Implement Hyperparameter-Tuning strategies (e.g. using a range of values instead of one value for hyperparameters, strategy to counteract the effect of class imbalance in the dataset of the supervised learning algorithm…)

6.Model Testing/Predictions
○Test the model with the testing data against the benchmark model and with the evaluation metrics we defined earlier.
